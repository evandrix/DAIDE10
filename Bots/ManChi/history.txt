Man'chi Diplomacy AI -- HISTORY

Version 7: August 4/2003
Improvements in tactical move generation.  Scoring is now done based
on all tentative moves, so it understands concepts like moving into a
province from which another unit is moving out.  More understanding on 
cutting support, but incomplete.  No strategic improvements.

Version 6: June 28/2003
Redesign of much of the tactical move generation and evaluation, 
for a much clearer understanding of "why" behind each move.  Still 
considers moves mostly one a time, without looking at the big picture.
Play has improved but still suffers from many problems.  The most
interesting part is a framework for automatically running tactical
situation tests and comparing generated against expected orders.
A single test can be opened in the application, or all tests can be 
run at once (via tactest).

Version 5: April 11/2003
Created several robots, mainly for play with the DAIDE server.  These
just connect existing pieces from the previous version (and thus the
same problems exist).  But its interesting to watch the robots play.

Version 4: April 4/2003
The first release that could actually do something useful!  The move
generation mostly works, but often results in poor moves.  There are a
large number of issues related to the choosing, rating and comparison 
of goals.  It can also play against the DAIDE server.  Note that this 
version doesn't appear that exciting at first glance: a lot of move 
analysis is done (and displayed) but later ignored.

Version 3: Jan 7/2003
Through 2002 I worked on various bits of the program, mainly cleaning
up existing old stuff into a (mostly) working program.  Man'chi still
couldn't play at game, but at least most of the pieces for loading and
analyzing a game fit together.  This was the first real public release.

Version 2: Apr 26/2002
The "Geography is Destiny" article by Paul Windsor seemed an excellent
beginning for a strategic analysis to me.  Version 2 included this 
analysis and enough pieces to display it, but nothing else.  It was 
distributed to a few interested people only.  The name Man'chi was 
chosen at this time.  It is a fictitious word from an oddly appropriate 
book I was reading -- see the quote on the About dialog.

Version 1:
I re-discovered Diplomacy about the same time I was learning Java, and
used development of a Diplomacy display & mapping program as an excuse
and exercise to experiment with Java.  Over a couple of years the code
grew in various bits and pieces, often unrelated to one another.  I
never really got anything finished nor intended to show the code to 
anybody else.  In early 2002 I decided developing a Diplomacy AI was
a fascinating challenge and arbitrarily declared my half finished
pieces as the "first" version.  It was never released.
