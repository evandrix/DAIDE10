To Do List

The following items are still to be implemented in the DAIDE Mapper :

+ Automatically disband if no retreat possible.
+ Automatically waive if no open home centres.
+ Show the game history
+ Remember the recently used Server IP/names and have a combobox to reselect them.
+ Allow the gamename to be entered and then displayed in the title bar
+ Allow the user to select the unit colours.
+ Add a variant information tab to the information pane.
+ Allow parameters for connection to be specified on command line, and connection
  to be made on program startup.
+ Put the summary into the Variant and Game Info tab
- Find out why connection loss isn't being detected.
- Don't crash if OFF received while summary dialog showing
- Last results are not shown (on the map or in the last results box) if 
  you join as an observer.
- Work out why the display isn't working properly on a 640x400 screen
- Add CHO token to language translation
+ Translate incoming HUH and TRY press messages, using the information to grey
  out the buttons the recipient cannot handle on the press composer dialog.
- Mapper doesn't send a FM low level message before exiting (CSPDLL bug?)
+ Allow provinces and units to be picked off the map when composing press
+ Display press to/from different powers on different tabs
+ Datestamp press
- "I Suggest" needs its translation changing to be "It would be in our 
  interests if", to make the difference between Suggest and Propose more obvious.
- The "FOR" token is not working properly. "Fall This Year" became "Fall 
  1926" during the composing process...
- The server rejected the following messages that the Mapper composed OK. I 
  need to figure out where the problem is in each case.
  7 >> SND ( 27 ) ( ENG ) ( IDK ( WHT ( ENG AMY NWY ) ) ) WRT ( ENG 20 )
  Didn't like "IDK ( WHT"
  2 >> SND ( 34 ) ( ITA RUS TUR ) ( POB ( WHY ( PRP ( ALY ( FRA ITA RUS TUR ) 
  VSS ( AUS ) ) ) ) ) WRT ( ITA 23 )
  Didn't like WHY ( PRP in this context - but presumably allowed it in the 
  message that this is a reply to.
  6 >> SND ( 63 ) ( AUS ) ( YES ( THK ( NOT ( QRY ( SCD ( TUR RUM ) ) ) ) ) ) 
  WRT ( AUS 77 )
  It didn't like YES ( THK ( NOT ( QRY. Should you be able to reply YES to 
  such a message?
  2 >> SND ( 48 ) ( ITA ) ( BWX ( WHY ( PRP ( PCE ( FRA ITA ) ) ) ) ) WRT ( 
  ITA 49 )
  Didn't like BWX as a reply to WHY either.
- Put the Bot name and power played in the title bar.
- Update variants from http://www.brainshell.org/diplomacy/mapper-variants.zip
- Check outgoing messages for illegal tokens in DLL
- Report errors in incoming messages up to the Server from DLL
- Ensure EM responses are sent BEFORE the connection is closed in DLL.
- Make token error checking in the DLL optional.
- Include the year in the human-readable draw message when a DIAS draw is
  declared.
+ Add a timestamp to incoming messages. Also add a turn-stamp. Two new columns...
- Report when a CCD message is received due to a press message being sent to
  a disconnected power.
+ As a convoy is entered, show the move being built up, step by step
+ Don't allow more builds or removals to be entered than are due.
- The flashing unit does not stop flashing if selected when the turn processes.
+ Add an adjudicator option to enter orders without using TokenMessages (AiClient)
+ Add an adjudicator option to set all units to hold (AiClient)
+ Modify TokenMessage to not check contents when setting from another TokenMessage.
+ Warn if reloading a crashed game doesn't get to the game start messages before EOF
+ Add an easy way to see what a void order was. E.g. right-click unit.
+ Make the draw button polarity clearer. Checkbox?
- When you change the map display, save it, exit and restart, the combobox isn't
  set up correctly.

Done in latest version - Mapper
+ In a level 8000 press, the return key sends a free text message, not an admin message
+ New map and unit styles available on map tab
+ 1898 and 1900 variants added

Plus the following items are outstanding for the DAIDE Server :

++Allow multiple games on one server!
++Allow a remote game manager
+ Implement load and save game
+ Allow the gamename to be entered and then displayed in the title bar
+ Delete logs automatically at some point.
+ Allow the game to be paused, and stepped through turns one at a time.
- The server is meant to remove any high level tokens from a HUH message, and then
  may reorder the other tokens.
- Don't allow eliminated countries to be in country lists, where it is not allowed
- Fix island provinces in variants - they are in the wrong category
- Send a CCD message for any power which NMRs, and a NOT( CCD ) when it sends any 
  subsequent message
- Accept and log a HUH or PRN message from a client.
- Check that HUH press messages contain an ERR token
- Update variants from http://www.brainshell.org/diplomacy/server-variants.zip
- Check the sending of TME messages. See Inbox, 12 May 2006 03:10:52
- Why does server log an error when receiving NOT(TME)? See log in 
  Inbox, 12 May 2006 12:57:45
+ Timestamp messages in the server log.
+ Allow a window to be opened to display all press sent and received by all powers.
- Can get a connection in a state where it can't be ejected or killed. Eric managed 
  to do this...
- When performing a CD disband, break distance ties more sensibly (currently based 
  on multimap ordering).
- Check what happens if a TME message is sent to the server with a time that is 
  already passed.
- Fix assertion on starting Americas4 game.
+ Make the server run at higher priority, with a command line option to run at normal 
  priority instead.
- Allow *.clg logging to be turned off without turning off tcpiplog.txt
  logging (command line option).
- -h (hide) option does not work.
- Exiting with a Connection Information Dialog open (at the end of the game) doesn't 
  close the dialog.
+ Supports which cannot be necessary should not be accepted (e.g. Ven s Tri in S1901)
+ Don't accept convoy orders for convoys which cannot be made (e.g. IRI c Ruh - Mun
  or EMS c Tun - Syr with no fleet in ION).

Done in latest version - Server
+ 1898 and 1900 variants added

+ = Additional functionality.
- = Bug/Fix.
