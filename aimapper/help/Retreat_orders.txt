How To Enter Retreat Orders

All orders are entered by clicking on the map. To start, click on the unit
you want to order. Then enter the order...

- To enter a Disband order, click on the unit again.
- To enter a Retreat order, click on the retreat destination.

When you are done, hit the Submit Button to send your orders to the Server.

Note that if you have a retreat that must be disbanded, you must still 
order the disband. Forced disbands are not automatically ordered for you.
