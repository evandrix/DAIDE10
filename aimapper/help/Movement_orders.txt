How To Enter Movement Orders

All orders are entered by clicking on the map. To start, click on the unit
you want to order. Then enter the order...

- To enter a Hold order, click on the unit again.
- To enter a Move order, click on the destination.
- To enter a Support order, right-click on the unit to support.
- To enter a Move By Convoy order, click on the sea provinces the army moves
through. Then finally click on the destination.

That's it, it's that simple... except there are two things missing...

When supporting a unit, if you have ordered the supported unit to move, then
the support will be for it to move. If the supported unit has not been 
ordered to move, then the support will be to hold. In other words, if you
want to support a unit to move, then enter the move order first.

Convoy orders do not need to be entered at all ! When you order an army to
move by convoy, all the fleets it passes through are automatically ordered
to convoy it.

And finally, to support or convoy foreign units, order the foreign unit as
if it was your own. The order will appear in brackets to indicate it is a
foreign order, and the order won't actually affect that unit. But it does
allow you to support or convoy the foreign unit in its action.

When you are done, hit the Submit Button to send your orders to the Server.
