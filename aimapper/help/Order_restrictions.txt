Order Restrictions

The DAIDE Server is a lot more restrictive about the orders which it will
accept than the Judges. It is designed on the basis that it will not accept
any order which, irrespective of the other orders entered, will be marked
as void. The major effects of this are :

- A fleet can't convoy a unit to a province it can't get to.
- A fleet can't convoy a unit if it is not at sea.
- A support can not be given to a province a unit cannot get to.
- Switzerland does not exist.
