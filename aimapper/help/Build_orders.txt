How To Enter Build Orders

All orders are entered by clicking on the map.

- To build an army, left-click on the home centre you wish to build in.
- To build a fleet, right-click on the home centre you wish to build in.
- To cancel a build order, click on the order in the orders list, and then
click the Cancel Order button.
- If you do not order sufficient builds, the remainder will be waived
automatically.

When you are done, hit the Submit Button to send your orders to the Server.

Note that if you do not have any open home centres, you must still hit
the Submit button in order to submit your waive orders. Unusable builds
are not automatically waived.
