About the DAIDE Project

In the past, there have been a number of attempts to write Diplomacy AI's. 
The AH Diplomacy Game, The DPP, The Hasbro Diplomacy Game, SeaNail, ... But 
what has never been done before, is to attempt to set up an environment 
where different Diplomacy AIs can play against each other. So in early 2002, 
the "Diplomacy AI Development Environment" Project was started, to do 
exactly that.

The system consists of a server which runs the games, and a number of 
clients, each of which is either a player or an observer in the game. The
clients connect to the server via TCP/IP, using a specially designed
protocol. This protocol includes all the communication requirements needed
to run the game, submit orders and send results, and to send and receive
press.
