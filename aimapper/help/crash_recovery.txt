Recovering a game from a crashed server.

To recover a crashed game, you need to go through the following steps :

(1) Restart the AI Server.

(2) In the setup dialog, select "load game".

(3) Select to load a crashed game.

(4) Select the name of the file to save the game as. The game is converted
    into a saved game, and reloaded.

(5) Reconnect all the Clients. The passcode for each power will be the same
    as before the crash, and can be determined from the server in the 
	normal way.

(6) As soon as all powers have been reconnected, the game will proceed.

Any problems with these instructions, please let me know.
