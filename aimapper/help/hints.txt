Hints and Tips

Most of the DAIDE interface is pretty obvious. However, there are one or
two features that you may not find by accident.

- By default, the Data Pane will switch to the Incoming Press tab if a message
  is received. However, if you right-click a tab, it will lock the selection,
  and if a message is received, the Incoming Press tab will just flash until
  you select it (or right-click again to unlock). A locked tab appears 
  highlighted.
