<h2>David's Diplomacy AI Page</h2><p>

This page contains the files I've made available for the DAIDE project. 
I've also written an <a 
href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/explain.htm">explanation 

of how to use them</a>.</p><p>

</p><h3>Executables</h3><p>

These all require Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP. For NT, Service Pack 6 is 
required.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/aimapper.msi">The DAIDE 
Mapper</a> is a version of Mapper for use with the AI Server. It 
provides a map which is updated in real time from the server. It can act
 either as an observer to let you see the game as it progresses, or as a
 Human Client to allow you to play against the AI's (or against other 
Humans)</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/aiserver.msi">The DAIDE 
Server</a> is the central server for the DAIDE project. It runs the 
games played between the AIs. As it is developed, and bugs are fixed, 
new versions will be uploaded here on a regular basis. The zip file 
contains everything that is needed to get the Server running on a Win32 
machine.</p><p>

Everybody else has written a <a 
href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/holdbot.zip">Holdbot</a> so I
 thought I should do so too...</p><p>

And once you've got a HoldBot, the next thing to write is a <a 
href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/randbot.zip">RandBot</a></p><p>

If you want something that plays a little better than either of these, 
then try <a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/dumbbot.zip">DumbBot</a></p><p>

Other Bots are also available from other Authors. See <a 
href="http://www.daide.org.uk/clients.xml">the DAIDE Central Website, 
Client Download page</a> for details.</p><p>

</p><h3>Documents</h3><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/overview.rtf">The DAIDE 
Overview</a> gives an overview of the project, and how it all fits 
together.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/daide_syntax.pdf">The 
DAIDE Syntax Document</a> gives the syntax that AI Clients must use to 
connect to the AI Server. Note that the tokens in this document are 
encoded into 16 bit values, not sent as text over the TCP/IP link.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/daide_protocol.html">The 
Low Level Protocol</a> explains how the messages are sent over a TCP/IP 
connection.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/faq.rtf">The FAQ</a> 
contains questions and answers on the project. Currently they are mainly
 questions about why things have been done the way they have.

</p><h3>Source Code</h3><p>

Microsoft Visual Studio Version 6 or above is required to build this 
software.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/aiclient.zip">The AI 
Client Framework</a> is a framework which does all the basic stuff an AI
 has to do, leaving the AI programmer to get on with the difficult bit !
 Based on three classes - MapAndUnits contains all the information on 
the game map and the current position. AiClientDlg contains the main 
dialog (which does very little), and BaseBot is the Base class from 
which the users AI is derived. It can equally well be used as the basis 
for an observer.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/holdbot_source.zip">The 
Holdbot above</a> was written using the above framework. This file 
contains the two new and one changed file that must be added to the AI 
Client Framework Project to make it into a HoldBot.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/randbot_source.zip">The 
Randbot above</a> was written using the above framework. This file 
contains the two new and one changed file that must be added to the AI 
Client Framework Project to make it into a RandBot.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/dumbbot_source.zip">The 
DumbBot above</a> was also written using the AI Client Framework. Once 
again, DumbBot requires just three files - a .cpp and .h for the Bot 
class, and a new Bot_Type.h to set the type of Bot. DumbBot was written 
in just 2 days, and the logic is all pretty simple. As such it is a 
fairly good coding example of how to write a slightly competent Bot.</p><p>

In order to compile these, you need the DAIDE CSP DLL, written by Andrew
 Rose. The latest version can be found at <a 
href="http://www.daide.org.uk/index.xml">the DAIDE Central Website</a>. 
However, at times, the latest version of the code there will not work 
with the above source, until I have the time to update the AI Client 
Framework to include the latest modifications. The version of the DAIDE 
CSP DLL which works with the above Source code can be found <a 
href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/sdk.david.00.03.zip">here</a>.</p><p>

There is no proper help for The AI Client Framework. However there is a 
text file containing a series of e-mails where I explain how it is meant
 to all work <a 
href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/dipai/aiclient.txt">here</a>.</p><p>

The source code for the Mapper and Server are not currently available, 
as I am still developing them, and want to avoid the problems of source 
control, etc. However, if there is a specific module that you'd like to 
see the source code for, then please ask. Here is:
